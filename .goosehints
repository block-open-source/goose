This is a python CLI app that uses UV. Read CONTRIBUTING.md for information on how to build and test it as needed.
Some key concepts are that it is run as a command line interface, dependes on the "ai-exchange" package, and has the concept of toolkits which are ways that its behavior can be extended. Look in src/goose and tests.
Once the user has UV installed it should be able to be used effectively along with uvx to run tasks as needed
